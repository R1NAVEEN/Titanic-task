## Description:

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## About Dataset

The Titanic Passenger dataset provides information about passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage. This dataset is often used for exploring patterns and factors associated with survival on the Titanic.

The dataset includes the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived: Survival status of the passenger (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived).

Pclass: Passenger class (1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class).

Sex: Gender of the passenger.

Age: Age of the passenger.

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.

Fare: Fare paid by the passenger.

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Objective:

Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).

Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not.

Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
